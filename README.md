## Description

*This is the assignment in Introduction to Artificial Intelligence.*

Predicting worker's productivity is a typical job in managing level, its not only for Employee Performance Assessment, but also highly related to production planning, demand forecast and capability improvement.

In this case, it is a highly labor-intensive industry that requires a large number of human resources to produce its goods and fill up the global demand for products.

Because of the dependency on human labor, the production of a company comprehensively relies on the productivity of the employees who are working in different departments of the company.

A common problem in this industry is that the actual productivity of the employees sometimes does not meet the targeted productivity that was set for them by the authorities to meet the production goals in due time.

When the productivity gap occurs, the company faces a huge loss in production. Such prediction performance can indisputably help the manufacturers to set an accurate target, minimize the production loss and maximize the profit.

## Evaluation

Evaluation will be Mean Absolute Error In statistics, mean absolute error (MAE) is a measure of errors between paired observations expressing the same phenomenon. Examples of Y versus X include comparisons of predicted versus observed, subsequent time versus initial time, and one technique of measurement versus an alternative technique of measurement.

## Model

I used random forest algorithm to fit the model, and finally get the 0.07578 MAE score in private test data.
